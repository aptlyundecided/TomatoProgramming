# Namespaces

I've read that using NameSpaces with ES6 (import) is a bad practice.  And this makes sense to me as namespaces rely on this funky (/// reference) shit.  So, with that, considering that I'm exclusively using angular and node.js, I'll be sticking with ES6 and skipping the namespace altogether for now.
