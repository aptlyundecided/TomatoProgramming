# What is Tomato Code?

At least 5 days of the week, I will write code, read, do tutorials, SOMETHING to continue progressing as a programmer, developer, engineer, whatever you want to call it.

This repository will be my way of tracking what I am doing, and a way to hold myself accountable.

I'll open a project for the 'categories' I want to learn about, and I'll use issues to document my learning process.  The projects should then be a fairly well laid out path following my journey, with the completed/closed issues being my notes.
